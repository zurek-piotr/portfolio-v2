As a Tech Lead, I focus on honest communication, understanding business and technical needs, as well as teaching and developing the team.\n\nI believe that knowledge is for sharing, and not to keep for yourself. I am open to a new challenge, so if you are interested in working with me, let me know!"    },

In my first job as an IT specialist, I gained experience in working with clients and gained extensive knowledge of servers and networks. \n\nIn 2020, my commercial adventure as a FullStack Developer began, which in 2022 it turned into the role of Tech Leader. During this time, I gained experience in working with various technologies, such as Angular, Laravel, Typscript, PHP, Node.js, FastAPI, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.\n\nWorking on the development of a huge ERP project created since 1989, I have experienced problems of scale, integration with many other systems/services and migration. \nIn such a large project, I gained experience in team management, planning, estimating, as well as project management. \nRecent years have allowed me to gain experience in AI projects such as AI chat, predictive models. \n\nIf you want to learn more about my experience, please visit my LinkedIn or CV at the bottom of the page."    },
